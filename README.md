# Practice Gatsby Monorepo

Project intended to practice a number of concepts, particularly the basics of gatsby and also the managing shared components/styles among multiple gatsby sites in a monorepo.

I also wanted to better understand the build process in monorepos - I am hosting [multiple](https://practice-gatsby-monorepo-site1.netlify.app/) [sites](https://practice-gatsby-monorepo-site2.netlify.app/) from this repo via Netlify.

A nice extension project would be to use nrwl's nx library for dependency analysis to properly manage/limit the CI process during netlify builds. See [here](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/21/deploying-nx-monorepos-to-netlify/) for more information about how this would work.
